As applications grow in size, they grow in complexity. A STOSA-based application can grow larger and be managed by a larger development team than a non-STOSA-based application. As such, it can scale much larger while still maintaining solid, documented, supportable interfaces.

A STOSA-based organization can handle larger and more complicated applications than a non- STOSA organization. This is because STOSA shares the complexity of a system across multiple development teams effectively and efficiently, while maintaining clear ownership and lines of responsibility.
