Often, in a strong STOSA-based organization, service teams may choose not to make use of a standard shared core and support capabilities. As an example, they may support their own database rather than using a database provided and supported by a centralized database team. Or they could decide to use their own cloud provider rather than the cloud provider supported by the operations team.

As long as the service team meet their specified requirements, they do not necessarily need to be forced to use these common infrastructure components. Of course, there are advantages to the service team to utilize standard, shared capabilities. If they chose not to use these supported shared capabilities, they may in fact generate additional support headaches for themselves. The key though, is that this decision is the decision of the service team to make — and to live with the repercussions.

One advantage of this model is it gives motivation and responsibility to the core teams to treat the service teams as real customers…customers that can go somewhere else if they don’t provide the capabilities they require. This can provide strong motivation for a centralized team to provide higher quality offerings to the service teams.

Your organization does not have to do this to support STOSA, and in fact your organization may put in service requirements that require the use of core infrastructure components. But, in general, the greater the flexibility given to the service teams, the greater the ingenuity and ultimately the better the services that are produced.
